        In 1991, Mack Richardson opened the doors of Rocket Comics in
        Burlington, NC. It was an exciting time to be a comic book fan and,
        doubly so, for those who wanted to share their love of comics with
        others. Mack's shop was a place where fans could gather, talk about
        their favorite characters, and discover new stories. It was a comic book
        shop meant for comic book fans.

        Even though the shop has been closed for many years now, the spirit of
        Rocket Comics lives on. This site is a tribute to the shop and the fans
        who made it a special place.

        The comic book industry <i>(and world, at large)</i> has changed so much
        over the last 30 years. In many ways, it seems to be a much more challenging
        environment to successfully operate a comic book shop. That being said, plans
        are in the works to reopen Rocket Comics. <strong>Stay tuned!</strong>
